a. I ran into trouble with calling nodes from the main, so I added an additional call function to call with the root node for a few of my functions.
b. Insert Best: O(1) Insert Worst: O(n) Search Best: O(1) Search Worst: O(n)
c. Time taken Insert(1000): 0.00053737
   Time taken Insert(2000): 0.00386756
   Time taken Insert(3000): 0.00594464
   Time taken Search(1000): 0.000489145
   Time taken Search(2000): 0.00526295
   Time taken Search(3000): 0.0076728
d. The code could be improved with more care given to functions in terms of calling a node.
